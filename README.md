# RunningLogAnalyzer
Reads in data from text file to show in console window and view dynamically
In this version the test.txt document can be used as reference to view a sample running log.
This test.txt was developed from my personal excel running log and the
python regex project in the PythonRegularExpressions repository.
The format for the test.txt is below:

mileage as a whole number
details
date

example:
```
10

4
run 4mi
2014-08-02
5
run 5mi/plyometrics
